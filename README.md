# HPE-CTY-Scrumbot
3. Integration with Jira: Botpress has an in-built feature of workflow which will execute / say something when a transition leads to a particular node. Similarly, here we have added a javascript file-'jira-updated.js' that performs the search query in Jira Query Language(JQL). The scrum owner can receive notifications on both their emails and on the channel of communication(Slack/Microsoft Teams).
The Jira Issues are written into a seperate text file.
The text file is then mailed to the scrum-owner along with the conversation data as discussed earlier.
